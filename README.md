# Neighborhood Map Project

The goal of this project is to develop a single-page application featuring a map of a neighborhood.  I went with a Retrowave Map theme for properties in and around my Seattle neighborhood.

## Project Implementation

Neighborhood Map uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Version 3.3.1 - fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library
* [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com) - Version 3.4.2 - javaScript library that helps you to create rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model

APIs:
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) - build customized, agile experiences that bring the real world to your users with static and dynamic maps, Street View imagery, and 360Â° views.
* [Google Street View Image API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro) - the Street View Static API lets you embed a static (non-interactive) Street View panorama or thumbnail into your web page, without the use of JavaScript.

Features:
* A full-screen map for properties using the Google Maps API
* A Street View Image for each property
* Map markers for a number of favorite properties in Seattle
* Property images from Google Images
* List of clickable provided Seattle properties
